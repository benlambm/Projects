      <p>
        You've learned HTML and CSS – great! Now it's time to see what
        JavaScript can do. Every page on this site showcases a different core
        concept, along with fun interactive demonstrations. Have your browser's
        console open (Right-click → Inspect → Console) to follow along with the
        commentary.
