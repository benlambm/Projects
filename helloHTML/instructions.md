A simple, beginner-friendly, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS web app structured into exactly three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js). The app should clearly demonstrate fundamental web concepts with minimal, freshman-level code and no comments. Include a basic interactive feature (e.g., quiz, calculator, form) with clear user feedback. Ensure the HTML is semantic and straightforward, the CSS visually appealing yet simple (padding, borders, centered layout, clear visual feedback), and the JavaScript minimal and easy to understand. After the initial implementation, enhance the UI slightly (e.g., emojis, dynamic colors, button state changes) to improve user experience and interactivity. Always handle edge cases gracefully (e.g., unanswered inputs). Keep the entire solution concise, pedagogically effective, and easily adaptable for similar beginner projects.
